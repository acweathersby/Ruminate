- [x] - Adjust size of code blocks
- [x] - total 9min - Get syntax highlighting working
- [x] - total 9min - Fix element offset when resolving pointer position within code blocks.
- [x] - total 28min -  Enable Rust debug toggle
                #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
- [x] - total 68min - Get basic inter-note rendering working
- [x] - total 50min - Get basic note (by id) save and retrieval working
- [x] - total 8min - Ensure path and name appear in note interface
- [x] - total 4min - Fix multi-line selection offsets
- [x] - total 300min - Improve performance of text updates

    Diff algorithms are prohibitively slow when processing large bodies of text at the
    character level. The solution being pursued is to actively track character level
    changes during an edit task and maintain diff patches alongside edit trees
    within the history.
- [x] - total 113min - Fix incorrect portions removed when doing multi-element text deletion.
- [x] - total 10min - Fix incorrectly set cursor offset at head of line. This can occur during insertion of new line.
- [x] - total 30min - Fix newline insertion at end of line.
- [x] - total 0min - Add logic that can insert header text in stem line.
- [x] - total 80min - Add logic that resolves stem lines.
- [x] - total 20min - Complete conversion of stem line to real line when space or other action is performed
