- [x] - total 4min - Fix multi-line selection offsets
- [x] - total 300min - Improve performance of text updates

    Diff algorithms are prohibitively slow when processing large bodies of text at the
    character level. The solution being pursued is to actively track character level
    changes during an edit task and maintain diff patches alongside edit trees
    within the history.
- [x] - total 113min - Fix incorrect portions removed when doing multi-element text deletion.
